# X-O Game (One Player) with 3 Modes (Without GUI)

The **X-O Game** (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to form a line of three identical symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this project, I've created a single-player version of the X-O Game with three different modes. The game is played against the computer (AI), and you can choose from the following modes:

1. **Easy Mode**:
    - The computer makes random moves without any strategy.
    - Suitable for beginners or casual play.

2. **Medium Mode**:
    - The computer tries to block the player from winning.
    - It also makes random moves if there's no immediate threat.
    - A balanced challenge for intermediate players.

3. **Hard Mode**:
    - The computer plays optimally using the minimax algorithm.
    - It aims to win or force a draw.
    - A tough opponent for advanced players.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/changizyv/X-O-Game-one-player-with-3-mode-whitout-GUI.git
      ```

2. **Run the Game:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
    - Execute the script by running:
      ```
      python xo_game.py
      ```
    - Follow the prompts to select the game mode (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
    - Input your moves by specifying the row and column (e.g., "1 2" for the middle cell).

3. **Enjoy the Game:**
    - The game board will be displayed, and you'll take turns with the computer.
    - The game ends when either you or the computer wins, or the board is full (a draw).

## Example Gameplay

1. Choose the game mode (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
2. Make your moves by entering the row and column numbers.
3. The computer responds with its move.
4. Continue until the game concludes.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and enhance the game further. Have fun playing! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€
